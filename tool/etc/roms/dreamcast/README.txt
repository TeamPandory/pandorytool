Filetypes: .cdi, .gdi

To add gdi/bin/raw, only place gdi files here e.g. CrazyTaxi.gdi, run pandory, then copy the rest of the bin/raw rom files to the destination folder on your USB stick, e.g. `mcgames/DCABCDE`. 

Rename the bin/raw files to match the name of the gdi file. Example DCABCDE_1.bin, DCABCDE_2.bin, DCABCDE_3.raw. Then edit the gdi file with notepad++ and change the file names to match. You should then be able to install your game.
